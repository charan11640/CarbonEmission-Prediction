# Carbon Emission Prediction Project  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting CO₂ emissions from country-specific data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze various factors that contribute to carbon emissions and build predictive models to estimate emissions based on historical and current data.  

## Project Structure  
The project is organized in a **Jupyter Notebook** (`Edunet Carbon emission.ipynb`), which contains all the code, visualizations, and analysis. The notebook is divided into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the project.  

## Key Features  

### **Data Collection**  
- Uses country-specific datasets with features related to CO₂ emissions.  

### **Data Preprocessing**  
- Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand relationships between variables and emissions.  

### **Model Development**  
- Implementation of machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions.  

### **Evaluation**  
- Performance metrics and validation techniques to assess model accuracy.  

### **Visualizations**  
- Graphs and charts to present findings and predictions effectively.
